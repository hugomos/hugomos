# Hi, I'm hugomos ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer, technology enthusiast, and very practical. Currently, I work in the development team at [Athenas Consultoria AgrÃ­cola e LaboratÃ³rios](https://athenasagricola.com.br), where I build tools and plugins focused on precision agriculture. I use [Python](https://www.python.org), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org), [QGIS](https://qgis.org/pt_BR/site/), and [ArcGIS](https://www.esri.com/pt-br/arcgis/about-arcgis/overview) in the development of these solutions.
